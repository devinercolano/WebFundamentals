          <h3>JavaScript Basics</h3><br>
          <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variet of reasons. It its a small lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it I can be connected to the objects of theses environments to provide programmatic control overtime.</p> <br>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values- imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class ="highlight">var x;</span></li>
            <li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable to a value to hold. The assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class ="highlight"> var x = 10;</span></li>
            <li><a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class ="highlight">true</span> or <span class ="highlight">false;</span> null - <span class ="highlight">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class ="highlight">42</span> or <span class ="highlight">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="highlight">“Coding Dojo Rocks”;</span> Array - <span class ="highlight">[1,’Coding’, 2,’Dojo’];</span> and Object - <span class ="highlight">{first_name: ’Jane’, last_name: ’Doe’}</span></li>
            <li><a href="#">Conditionals</a> when you write code, you will want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different color blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. Where are the following conditional statements: <span class ="highlight"> if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class ="highlight">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, it's the first condition is false; <span class ="highlight">else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
            <li><a href="#">Loops</a> there are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That’s a loop!</li>
            <li><a href="#">Function</a> functions are at an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a tone more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
